# CommonMark Sample Document

This is a comprehensive CommonMark document showcasing standard markdown elements for testing and benchmarking purposes.

## Introduction

CommonMark is a **standardized specification** of Markdown. This document demonstrates *all* the core elements that should be properly parsed and extracted.

### About Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It's designed to be *easy to read* and **easy to write**.

## Text Formatting

You can use various text formatting options:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks or underscores
- *Italic text* using single asterisks or underscores
- ***Bold and italic*** combined
- `inline code` for short snippets

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item 1.1
  - Nested item 1.2
- Third item
  - Nested item 3.1
    - Double nested 3.1.1
    - Double nested 3.1.2

### Ordered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step 2.1
   2. Sub-step 2.2
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step 3.1
4. Fourth step

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Use the `function_name()` method to process data.

### Code Blocks

```rust
fn hello_world() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.

> Blockquotes can contain **bold text** and *italic text*.
>
> They can also span multiple paragraphs.

## Horizontal Rule

## Tables

| Language | Type | Package Manager |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Python | Dynamic | pip |
| Rust | Compiled | cargo |
| JavaScript | Dynamic | npm |
| Java | Compiled | Maven |

## Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph with multiple types of formatting. It contains **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and [links](https://example.com).

### Complex Nested List

1. First item with **bold** and *italic*
   - Sub-item with `code`
   - Another sub-item with [link](https://example.com)
2. Second item
   - Multiple levels
     - Level 3 item 1
     - Level 3 item 2 with **formatting**
   - Back to level 2
3. Third item

## Conclusion

This CommonMark document includes all standard elements:
- Headers at multiple levels
- Paragraphs with inline formatting
- Unordered and ordered lists
- Nested lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Inline code
- Links and reference-style links
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Tables
- Mixed formatting and content

The document is structured for comprehensive testing of markdown parsing and extraction capabilities.
