Did you know that the first email was sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971? He used the "@" symbol to separate the user's name from the computer name, a practice that is still in use today.

Another interesting fact is that the first known instance of email spam occurred in 1978. A marketing message was sent to 393 recipients on ARPANET, marking the beginning of what we now know as email spam.
