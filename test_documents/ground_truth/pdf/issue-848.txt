The movie opens with a news report advertising the way of life in this future, which seems to be far from
ideal. Among other stories, three police oﬃcers have been murdered and a fourth, Frank Frederickson, has
been left critically injured in an attack by unoﬃcial Old Detroit crime boss Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood
Smith), wanted for the deaths of over 30 police oﬃcers. The Detroit Metropolitan Police Department's
union representatives blame Omni Consumer Products (OCP), who have recently entered a contract with
the city to run and manage the DPD, for putting their men in such dangerous environments.

At the Metro West Precinct in Old Detroit, oﬃcers respond to a variety of cases when veteran oﬃcer Alex
Murphy (Peter Weller) arrives, having been transferred in from Metro South. Desk Sergeant Warren Reed
gets Murphy a set of riot armor and introduces Murphy to the other cops, who are not happy about how
OCP seems to be trying to run the police force into the ground. As Murphy and the other cops are suiting
up in the locker rooms, one of them suggests that they go on strike to pressure OCP into giving them
better working conditions. At that point, Reed and another oﬃcer come in, carrying an evidence tray. Reed
removes Frederickson's nameplate from his locker, announcing that Frederickson has died, much to the
disappointment of the other cops in the locker room. Reed tells them that a memorial service will be held
the next day and admonishes them harshly about striking.
