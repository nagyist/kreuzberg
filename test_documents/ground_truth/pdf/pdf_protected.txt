                                               Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been
                                               primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research
                                               outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further
                                               investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases
                                               and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-
                                               portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going
                                               e↵orts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model
                                               development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer
                                               vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.
                                               This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to
                                               academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences
                                               and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source
                                               library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-
                                               tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and
                                               intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-
                                               tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.
                                               To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community
                                               platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-
                                               zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both
                                               lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.
                                               The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.

                                         1   Introduction
                                         Deep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of
                                         document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification [11,

37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].
A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the
manual specification of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional
methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad
spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.
    However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-
cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted
for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-
works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can
be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and
frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,
and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack
the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images
contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training
is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no
full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets
and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of
models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use
DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,
and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not
documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how
full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in
reinventing the DIA wheel.
    LayoutParser provides a unified toolkit to support DL-based document image
analysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser
is built with the following components:
 1. An o↵-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character
    recognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)
 2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that
    underlies the o↵-the-shelf usage
 3. Comprehensive tools for efficient document image data annotation and model
    tuning to support di↵erent levels of customization
 4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-
    tion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,
    reproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)
The library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacrificing
generalizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient
functions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with
existing DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated
tutorials, we hope this tool will benefit a variety of end-users, and will lead to
advances in applications in both industry and academic research.
    LayoutParser is well aligned with recent e↵orts for improving DL model
reusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com-
puter vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show
LayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects
