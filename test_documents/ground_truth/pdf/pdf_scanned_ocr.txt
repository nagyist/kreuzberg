Don Naylor, CAE
                            Dear Colleagues,
EXECUTIVECOMMITTEE          State universities and community college retirees and employees face increasing threats to
                            their pension and health benefits. The State of Illinois continues to face a structural deficit
President:
                            problem. The qovemor's recent push to sell the lottery system for an estimated $10 billion is

                            clear evidence of the problem. Rumors suggest that SURS will see yet a third year of

                            your pensions commonly referred to as defined benefits plans. After several years of
Past-President:             preparation SUAA created SUAACTION, a political involvement committee to become
David Hilquist (OCC)        politically active. In the past it was possible to successfully advocate legislatively through
1 Cayuga Court              lobbying. This is no longer the case since politics in Illinois has become a pay to play game.
Hawthorne Woods, IL 60047   To address these challenges to both active and retired SURS members, SUAA in 2005
(847) 823-2214
                            established SUAACTION. SUAACTION will serve as the political advocacy ann of SUAA.

(217) 782-2849              SUAACTION will focus its activities in four major areas: (1) securing full funding for SURS

                            benefits; (2) promoting the highest ethical and professional standards in the management of
Membe'-at-Large:            SURS assets; (3) preserving the health benefits we now enjoy; (4) expanding efforts to

(309) 833-1939              The SUAACTION political advocacy program wilt be expensive, and dues cannot be used

                            recommended that its activities be financed by voluntary contributions. Will you 'Volunteer?
