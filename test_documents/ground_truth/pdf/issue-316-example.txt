                                     Abstract
                                     Purpose – This research aims to investigate the efficacy of family involvement in shift work training
                                     targeting both physiological and social coping strategies.
                                     Design/methodology/approach – The study utilized repeated surveys of work-family conflict
                                     (WFC) and family-work conflict (FWC) in a naturally occurring field experiment. Three small process
                                     manufacturing sites introduced training for shift workers, with or without family involvement, and
                                     with or without training on managing relational aspects of shift-work.
                                     Findings – The inclusion of social coping strategies combined with family involvement significantly
                                     reduced work-family conflict. Open response categories on the survey suggest that these reductions
                                     were due to the facilitation of a joint problem solving approach by family members. In contrast,
                                     employee focused training on physiological coping alone appears to increase family conflicts.
                                     Research limitations/implications – As a field study, this paper cannot control for the
                                     particularities of family situations. It should also be noted that the participants were all male, and
                                     results may have differed for female shift workers given differing family and work expectations.
                                     Practical implications – For employers and OSH officers, this research suggests that broader
                                     spectrum training may assist shift workers in managing the requirements and impact of unsociable
                                     hours of work. For the shift worker, the research reinforces the importance of family support and
                                     family involvement in moderating shift work’s potentially negative effects.
                                     Originality/value – This is the first study to assess the impact of family involvement in training
                                     and development-based interventions. This paper provides a unique perspective on shift work
                                     interventions by documenting both content and process effects for shift work support.

                                     In discussing work-life balance, the focus is often on the amount of time spent at work,
                                     and flexibility of work time and place to accommodate family and other requirements.
                                     In both research and the popular literature, however, the focus of this balancing act is
                                     on a traditional 9-5 view of employment that spills over – in hours and energy – to a
                                     fairly traditional view of non-work life. The issue of balance may become more

that result in dynamic discontinuities between workers and the rest of their life. For the            Shift work
shift worker, the particular issues of work-life balance, stress and coping, are both              interventions
more complex and more compelling.
    The term “shift work” is used to refer to a way of organising the daily working
hours in which different persons or teams work in succession to cover more than the
traditional eight hours per day, up to and including the whole 24 hours (Costa, 2003).
Consequently, the term “shift work” does not include the typical 8am-5pm Monday to                         163
Friday working arrangements (Grosswald, 2002; Presser, 2003). There are literally
dozens of ways to structure shifts. In general they can focus on including or excluding
night work; they can include or exclude weekend work or parts thereof; they can vary
concerning flexibility of working times (e.g. rotating, permanent, split shifts) or the
regularity or irregularity of the shift cycle (Costa, 2003).
    Increasingly non-standard working hours such as shift work, weekend work and
split shifts are becoming the norm in industrialised, Western societies. According to a
survey on working conditions carried out in the European Union’s 15 member
countries (Boisard et al., 2002), only 24 per cent of the working population are now
engaged in so-called standard day work, that is between 7:30-8:00 am and 5:00 – 6:00
pm from Monday to Friday, and 18.8 per cent of the European work force is engaged in
shift work that includes night work. As early as 1991, Presser (1995, cited in
Grosswald, 2002) reported that approximately 45 per cent of Americans are employed
under some kind of shift work conditions.
    The reasons for this increased shift work are two-fold and closely linked: there is the
increased need for temporal flexibility of the organisation, as well as the economic
necessities and choices for the individual. Temporal flexibility is seen as one of the
milestones of labour flexibility on which most organisations are currently focused
(Costa, 2003). In this context, shift work is a widely used tool enabling the organisation
to be active around the clock in response to increasingly flexible market demands. This
is progressively more the case not only in necessary social services (like hospitals, the
police force, transport and electricity) or in highly technological industries (like
chemical and steel industry, power plants or mining), but also to support productive
and economic choices (for example bank branches opening late and on weekends, and
extended hours for restaurants, news and entertainment industries).
    Closely linked to this organisational focus are the needs of the individual. On a
rather worried note Presser’s (2003) findings suggest that, at least in the SA, a large
proportion of shift workers engage in this type of work because they could not get
other jobs and their choices were limited. European research (Presser, 1987) has
established similar findings, in that the ability to hold multiple jobs is one reason
people engage in shift work. According to Finn (1981) 23 per cent of night shift workers
and 19 per cent of evening shift workers had a second job, in comparison to 11 per cent
of “regular” day workers. Another more positive angle to shift work is suggested by
Coleman’s (1989) findings that some employees appreciate the possibility for shift
work, as it allows them to take time off mid-week and pursue leisure activities without
dealing with the large weekend crowds.
    In spite of shift work’ s advantages and increasingly “normality”, temporal
flexibility can still result in difficulties for the individual. These difficulties can often be
health related (Costa, 1996; Finn, 1981; Owen, 1985), but also extend to individuals’
participation in social events. Normal social patterns still tend to operate around the
ER     traditional workday cycle, which effectively excludes shift workers (Henderson and
29,2   Burt, 1998) and leads to difficulties in structuring family and social interactions
       (Knutson et al., 1986; Simon, 1987).
           Night work causes a mismatch between the light/dark sleep/wake cycles and
       consequently disturbs the normal circadian rhythms of psycho-physiological functions
       (Folkard et al., 1985; Minors and Waterhouse, 1986). These efforts tend to result in the
164    so-called shift-lag syndrome (Costa, 2003), which is characterised by feelings of fatigue,
       sleepiness, disorientation, digestive troubles, irritability, poorer mental agility and
       reduced performance efficiency. Although shift-lag symptoms affect the individual
       directly in the first instance, they also have a wider impact on the family and social
       environment of the individual as well as on the organisation employing shift workers.
           People engaged in shift work are frequently “out of sync” with society around them
       and can experience social marginalisation (Colligan and Rosa, 1990). This is especially
       true if they live in a family with school-aged children, as the social activities tend to be
       organised around the day-oriented rhythm of the general and school population. Time
       pressure can become a constant problem when shift workers attempt to organise
       family time tables with personal duties (e.g. school and house work) and the
       availability of community services (e.g. shop hours, transport, office hours). These time
       pressures can have negative influences on children’s education, marital and parental
       roles, and relationships (Costa, 2003; Loudon and Bohle, 1997). Additionally,
       constraints on effective participation in social and domestic life can produce a sense of
       social alienation and represent a major source of role conflict for shift workers (Bohle
       and Quinlan, 2000).
           The main role conflict a shift worker will experience is that between the roles of
       work and those of the family. While this conflict is not limited to shift workers, it has
       repeatedly and clearly been linked to time issues – an aspect that characterises shift
       work like no other work environment (Keith and Schafer, 1980; Pleck et al., 1980). The
       conflict between work and family roles has been conceptualised as consisting of two
       distinct but reciprocally linked pathways. On one hand, structural or developmental
       aspects of the family are increasingly recognised as having an impact on work
       behaviour. The inter-role conflict in which the demands of the family and the time
       devoted to it interfere with fulfilment of work-related responsibilities is termed
       family-work conflict or FWC (Frone et al., 1992; Netemeyer et al., 1996; Zedeck, 1992).
           On the other hand, participation in the work role may make full and satisfying
       participation in the family role more difficult. Demands of and time devoted to work
       can interfere with family-related responsibilities. This pathway is termed work-family
       conflict, WFC (Frone et al., 1992; Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985; Netemeyer et al., 1996).
       Both conflicts are distinct inter-role conflicts with different antecedents (Baltes and
       Heydens-Gahir, 2003; Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Both represent the degree to which
       roles and responsibilities from work and family domains are incompatible. This
       incompatibility is becoming an issue of concern as work and family life are no longer
       seen as separate segments in a person’s life, but are conceptualised as closely linked
       aspects of single personal experience.
           Regardless of the direction of the conflict, any conflict between work and family
       roles can increase stress (Pisarski et al., 1998) and is linked to job dissatisfaction, job
       burn out, and turnover (Burke, 1988; Frone et al., 1992; Greenhaus, 1988) as well as to
       life and marital dissatisfaction (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985; Gutek et al., 1991). The
links between the two conflicts had been demonstrated by Frone et al. (1992) and are            Shift work
explained as an example of the role spillover model (Barling, 1990). This model asserts      interventions
that there is a significant similarity between what happens at work and in the family. It
suggests that a person’s work experiences influence his or her behaviour at home,
influencing basic behaviours towards self and family members (Zedeck, 1992). In its
positive expression, this model is the notion of positive relationships between work and
family, for example that job satisfaction enhances family life. In its negative                      165
expression, the model asserts that negative experiences in family life, possibly as result
of role conflict due to shift work, create negative attitudes that can be carried over to
work life.
   Research into work-life balance and stress has established that conflict between
home and family leads to negative job related attitudes, including reduced job
satisfaction, increased tardiness, absenteeism, sickness, turnover and reduced
performance levels (Cooper and Cartwright, 1994; Friedman and Greenhaus, 2000;
Quick et al., 1997). Frone et al. (1992) found that the relationship between work – family
conflict and job related affect is not a direct one, but that it is mediated by the
frequency of family – work conflict. Therefore, the family environment appears to play
a central role when investigating the effects of shift work.

Interventions to improve coping by shift workers
Stress research proposes that job stress intervention processes can be divided into
three categories: those focusing on the individual (by learning to cope with stress),
those focusing on the organisation (by changing the work situation, thus tackling the
source of the problem) and those focusing on the individual-organisation interface (by
increasing the employee’s resistance to specific job stressors).
   Within these three focus points, stress management approaches generally
concentrate on primary coping strategies (i.e. reduction of stressors such as
work-family conflicts), or secondary coping strategies (i.e. altering employee responses
to job stressors such as ways of dealing with work-family conflicts once they arise).
(Discussion of tertiary coping strategies such as counselling and therapy is beyond the
scope of this paper; for more elaborate reviews see Lazarus and Folkman, 1984.)
   Based on the accelerating social changes that necessitate shift work, it is safe to
assume that the organisation-focused, primary intervention strategy of eliminating
shift work is of little practical value. Although it is within the possibility of many
organisations to minimise some of the negative aspects of shift work by changing from
rotating shifts to permanent shifts (Tepas, 1993), research has shown that many of the
negative consequences, especially the family related ones, remain valid for all types of
shift work. Therefore, the focus will remain on the individual employees and their
families when working with primary and secondary coping strategies.
   For the successful design and application of any coping strategies aimed at helping
shift workers to effectively deal with the challenges of their working life, family
support and help are of vital importance (Bohle and Tilley, 1998; Bostic, 1988). This
importance of the family is underscored by Frone et al. (1992) who found that the
relationship between work – family conflict and job related stress is not a direct one,
but that it is mediated by the frequency of family – work conflict. Further, MacEwen
and Barling (1998) suggest that employees with a high degree of family support are
more protected from the effects of work – family conflicts than employees with low
ER     levels of family support. This protection can be established on the practical level as
29,2   well as on a psychological and emotional level. For example, families can be supportive
       by reducing the clash between work and non-work activities (and the frequency of
       FWC) by restructuring meals and social and familial activities to accommodate the
       shift worker (Bohle and Tilley, 1998). Additionally, having the understanding and
       support of the family as well as maintaining contact with other shift worker families
166    can not only ease the practical burdens, but also the aspects of perceived social
       marginalisation and role conflict (Pisarski et al., 2002). Moreover, proper support from
       family and friends at home has been found to enhance both adaptability and tolerance
       to shift work (Loudon and Bohle, 1997; Walker, 1985), two aspects feeding into job
       satisfaction and perceived work-life balance.
          As it is in the interest of the individual as well as the organisation to achieve
       adaptability to and tolerance of shift work, workplaces increasingly turn to introducing
       shift work preparation strategies. These strategies aim at directly benefiting the
       employee, therefore improving his or her job satisfaction and thus benefiting indirectly
       the organisation as well (Henderson and Burt, 1998). Shift worker education
       programmes are one such strategy that attempts to change shift worker behaviour
       within the framework of primary and secondary stress interventions. These
       programmes may provide both relevant information to employees (communication
       of news, knowledge and facts), as well as educate staff on how to cope with the
       demands of shift work. Education here is defined as developing information,
       facilitating learning, training and implementation (Tepas, 1993). Ideally, these strategy
       and life style coping education sessions are conducted on an on-going basis to keep
       shift workers constantly aware of problems associated with the stresses of shift work
       as well as with relevant coping strategies (Monk, 2000).
          Research in the effectiveness of shift worker education programmes has shown mixed
       results. Some literature reviews report only anecdotal evidence for the effectiveness of
       shift worker education programmes (Tepas, 1993). Shift workers may reject reparation
       strategies involving sleeping patterns and/or restrictions on caffeine intake as irrelevant
       to them (Wedderburn and Scholarios, 1993). In general, it has been argued that the
       effectiveness of intervention strategies largely depends on two characteristics. One of
       these is the relevance of the information the individual is given (Tepas, 1993). A clear
       focus on relevance of shift worker educational programmes to the employee situation has
       repeatedly been found to have a positive impact on acceptance of its message (Carlson,
       1991). In addition, successful shift work education programmes must be relevant,
       practical as well as socially acceptable to the individual as well as the family members
       affected (Tepas, 1993). Generally, very few coping strategies have been found to work well
       without this family or social support (Monk, 2000). Since a large proportion of shift work
       stressors are related to the difficulties experienced when balancing work and family roles
       (Pleck et al., 1980), it is reasonable to expect that employee change is more likely to occur if
       the training programmes are relevant to these aspects as well as to the physical issues of
       eating and sleeping routines.
          The second aspect increasing the effectiveness of shift work education initiatives is
       how skilled the shift worker is in using the given information (Tepas, 1993). In the case
       of shift work and family demands, this is probably not only an issue of the employee’s
       skill in applying the information, but also the skill levels of family and friends of the
       employee who are also required to change behaviours. Therefore, it does appear to
make sense that shift intervention programmes include family members as active                 Shift work
participants (Tepas, 1993). Finally, as argued earlier, work and family demands can         interventions
influence each other in both directions. Therefore, it is suggested that when evaluating
shift-worker intervention strategies one needs to look at the effect these interventions
have on both family-work conflict and work-family conflict. Due to the reciprocal,
mediating effects these role conflicts have on each other, it can be argued that shift
work intervention programmes involving family members and addressing both                           167
conflicts will have greater beneficial effects than interventions aiming at reducing only
one of the conflicts. However, there is a clear lack of field experimental research into
this area.
   The present study fills this gap by exploring, in a naturally occurring field setting,
whether involvement of the family in shift work support training, and enlargement of
the scope of training by inclusion of socio-emotional aspects of shift work, improves
the work-family outcomes for shift workers.

Method
The data was gathered through initial and six-monthly follow-ups at three industrial
sites that adopted different interventions to improve job satisfaction and occupational
safety and health for shift-workers. The research design is that of a naturally occurring
field experiment, with repeated measures at three sites, each of which adopted a
different approach to shift-worker training and development. The researchers were not
involved in the interventions at these sites, but were there to collect longitudinal data
on shift work patterns and impacts as part of a larger national study of shift workers
over two decades of workplace reform.

Participants
Participants in the study were employed as shift-workers in three continuous
processing (metallurgy) industrial sites. Each site had between 170 and 210 shift
employees, generally in direct production or production-supervision roles. The factory
workers were employed on eight-hour rotating shifts, with very little overtime. Each
site surveyed all shift-workers by asking for completion at the shift break. Both
management and the union at the site supported the research programme, and
completion rates were high (over 90 per cent in each administration).
    Across the three sites there were 503 participants in total, divided almost equally
between sites. A total of 85.9 per cent had partner/spouse and all had families in the
area; only participants with partners and families were included in this aspect of the
study, consistent with prior research on work-family conflict (Baltes and
Heydens-Gahir, 2003), resulting in a final sample of 432. Participants were all male,
with an age range of 28-61, and a mean age of 41.33 years. Participants had over eight
years of service on average, with a range of two to 18 years of service. There were no
statistically significant demographic differences between work sites.

Interventions
While acknowledging that there were significant issues associated with shift-work,
management at each plant took different approaches to providing support to
shift-workers. At site A, shift workers were seen as requiring health and safety
support, as work-family issues were not seen as appropriate for workplace discussion.
ER     Accordingly, this site provided two half-day sessions in maintaining alertness, with a
29,2   focus on diet and exercise. The on-site industrial nurse provided the training.
       Extending access to an occupational nurse into the evening shift supported this
       initiative. This forms our de facto control group for family inclusion.
           In site B, training and development focused on a broader range of behaviours and
       specifically dealt with diet, exercise and sleep both at home and at work, and with
168    managing time and priorities between work and family. The training occurred in two
       half-day sessions, conducted by the industrial nurse and an outside trainer, with the
       nurse “on call” for further enquiries. This provided a training condition addressing the
       work-family aspect as well as family-work issues, but without active involvement of
       the families in the training process.
           In Site C, the same training materials and trainers were used, but shift-workers were
       asked to attend with their partners/spouses. The training sessions were each one hour
       longer to accommodate more group discussions and questions. Ongoing support was
       provided with handouts and an ongoing newsletter that was sent to workers’ homes.
       This provided a training condition addressing work-family aspects as well as
       family-work issues and included active family involvement in the training.

       Instrumentation
       The data on work-family interaction was gathered as part of a larger survey project on
       consequences of shift-work. This portion of the research was assessed using the
       five-item work-family conflict and five-item family-work conflict scales (Netemeyer
       et al., 1996). The scale items appear below. Participants were asked to respond using a
       seven-point Likert scale with values ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
       agree). Coefficient alpha in this study was 0.91 for the WF conflict scale, and 0.93 for
       the FW conflict scale.
           Items in the WF conflict scale were:
          (1) The demands of my work interfere with my home and family life
          (2) The amount of time my job takes up makes it difficult to fulfil my family
                responsibilities.

                puts on me.
          (4) My job produces strain that makes it difficult to fulfil family duties.
          (5) Due to work-related duties, I have to make changes to my plans or family
                activities.

       Items in the FW conflict scale were:
          (1) The demands of my family or spouse/partner interfere with work-related
              activities.
          (2) I have to put off doing things at work because of demands on my time at home.
          (3) Things I want to do at work do not get done because of the demands of my
              family or spouse-partner.
          (4) My home life interferes with my responsibilities at work such as getting to work
              on time, accomplishing daily tasks, and working overtime.
          (5) Family-related strain interferes with my ability to perform job-related duties.
In addition to the scales, participants were provided with open-response questions                 Shift work
regarding both positive and negative aspects of their work and family interaction:              interventions
   .
      What are the most positive impacts of work on your family?
   .
      What are the most negative impacts of work on your family?
   .
      What are the most positive impacts of family on your work?

      What are the most negative impacts of family on your work?                                             169
Responses to the open ended questions were coded and analysed thematically and then
assessed through frequency counts.

Results
This research assessed whether work-life balance training improves shift-workers’
experience of work and family, and if this is enhanced by family participation in the
training. The dependent variables across all three conditions are composite scores on
WFC and FWC. A 3 £ 2 £ 3 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with
repeated measures was performed to test the impact of the training.

Impact of training on WFC and FWC
The mean scores and standard deviations for WFC before the interventions were
similar, with Site B reporting the highest mean score (28.5, std 2.6), compared to Site A
(27.1, std 2.1) and site C (26.6, std 2.4). Although the mean WFC scores declined in all
three sites, there were noticeable differences in the magnitude of this decline. For Site A
the difference in mean WFC score was 2.4 points, for Site B it was 10.9 points and for
Site C 13.4 points.
   Although all three sites reported a decrease in work-family conflict after the training
at Time 2, this decrease was the strongest for Site C, where the family had been
involved in the training. The decrease was least at Site A, where training was focused
on diet and sleeping pattern advice to shift workers only. These results are graphically
summarised in Figure 1. Analysis of variance underscores a significant interaction
effect for training type by family involvement on work-family conflict, as outlined in
Table I. The data suggests that involving the family in training and development

ER                       focused on a broader range of relevant behaviours had the most significant impact on
29,2                     the reduction of WFC.
                            For the measure of FWC the mean scores were noticeably lower than those reported
                         for WFC. Before the interventions the FWC mean scores and standard deviations were,
                         again, similar across sites, with Site C reporting the highest mean score (15.8, std 1.6)
                         compared with Site A (14.9, std 1.9) and Site B (14.2, std 2.2). After the interventions,
170                      the Site C average score was lower than before (10.2, std 1.8) as was the score of site B
                         (13.9, std 2.5). Site A, however, reported a higher mean score than before the health
                         advice treatments were introduced (16.1, std 1.8). (Refer to Figure 2 for visual
                         summary).
                            The multivariate analysis results are also less pronounced for FWC; only the
                         interaction of family and training is significant at the 0.05 level and there are no
                         signficant main effects for training type or family involvement (Table II).
                            For FWC, however, significant differences are found between the control and the
                         family training site post-intervention ðt ð162Þ ¼ 25:714; p , 0:01; n2 ¼ 0:42Þ; consistent
                         with the interaction effect of training and family involvement. Taken together, the survey
                         results suggest that involving the family in training and development focused on a
                         broader range of relevant behaviours, rather than physiological aspects alone, improves
                         outcomes in both FWC and WFC for shift workers.

The four open-ended text response questions were content analysed and categorised by           interventions
the researchers and an independent evaluator, who had been unaware of the aims and
the content of the study. Inter-rater reliability across all text coding was calculated at
0.89.
   WFC was explored through responses to the questions:
   .
      What are the most positive impacts of work on your family?                                             171
   .
      What are the most negative impacts of work on your family?

Respondents across all three sites at the beginning of the study expressed that the
rotating shifts and monthly four days in a row off that were part of their shift
structures, provided them with time to get more important things done around the
house or to take a break with their families (217 comments). This was the only response
where the working status of the partner played a role, as coordinating holiday or
respite schedules with a second employer was seen as difficult by workers across all
three sites, particularly as the partner was more likely to use much of their leave
entitlements to address family needs that the shift worker was not able to
accommodate. They also suggested that shift work allows them to provide a good
standard of living for themselves and their families (331 comments). Negative impacts
included (in order of frequency), constant tiredness (272 comments), being
“out-of-sync” with partner and children’s schedules (177 comments), not having a
social life (145 comments), and missing major events, such as birthdays, school events,
and sporting events (111 comments).
    The number of positive comments made after the intervention remained the same
for Site A, while it decreased for Site B ( 2 5.4 per cent) and increased at Site C (þ 12
per cent). Overall, the number of negative impacts listed declined by about 50 per cent
in the two family oriented training conditions (Sites B and C) when measured for the
second time. The overall decrease in negative impacts reported for Site A, with the
health-only training, was only 5.4 per cent. In particular, tiredness decreased across all
three sites. In all conditions, being “out-of-sync” with the family and missing important
family events were also mentioned less than in the time before the interventions. Going
against this trend, at Site B the number of comments related to no or disrupted social
life increased by 13.5 per cent (see Table III).

                          In response to the spillover effects of family on work, the level of expressed conflict on
                          FWC was lower for all groups, and this was reflected in far fewer comments in the open
                          section of the survey to the following two questions:
                             (1) What are the most positive impacts of family on your work?
                             (2) What are the most negative impacts of family on your work?

                          The 244 total responses received at Time 1 for these questions (222 at Time 2) were
                          grouped into one positive (family understands and supports me) and one negative
                          category (there are fights within the family about work schedules).
                              The number of positive comments made increased across all three conditions from
                          20 per cent at Site A to 48.4 per cent at Site B and even 108 per cent at Site C.
                              However, the most striking difference across conditions and time was the reduction
                          in listing of family arguments that carried over into work from the first to second
                          measurement, particularly in the training scenario including the family. While this was
                          reduced in all conditions (215 per cent at Site A, 2 54.6 per cent at Site B), it
                          disappeared entirely from the family training scenario (Site C) across the measurement
                          period. Of the respondents, seven specifically noted that completing the training with
                          their partners meant that they now approached this as a problem to be solved, and they
                          felt that they were working together more effectively with balancing work and family
                          commitments than they ever had before. These results are summarised in Table IV.

In summary, the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the collected data indicate            Shift work
that all three interventions can contribute to reductions in WFC as well as FWC,             interventions
although there are some aspects of the training that tend to heighten awareness rather
than resolve the problems directly, as we see in the increase in negative factors noted at
Site B. However, the largest positive effect arises from the involvement of the families
in training and development focused on a broader range of relevant behaviours and
risk factors.                                                                                        173
Discussion
Shift work has its positive sides as well as its conflict aspects. The present study
illustrated, that the traditional positive aspects of shift work – flexibility and pay –
were as much part of life for the employees at all three sites investigated as were the
negative sides. These negative aspects had been found to fall into two areas of conflict
that can have effects in two unique but related directions: from work into the family of
the shift worker, and from the family into the work place. The present research aimed
at exploring the differences three types of training can make on reported work-family
conflict and family-work conflict for shift workers.
    The importance of family involvement in awareness creation, training or behaviour
change for shift workers had been clearly demonstrated by the results relating to the
two sites introducing more extensive behaviour modification training. As previous
research indicated, the family environment appears to play a central role when trying
to alleviate the effects of shift work. The highly significant result for the interaction
effect for training by family involvement on work-family conflict is in support of
previous studies suggesting that, as the family bears the brunt of a shift worker’s
conflicts, the family is also the deciding factor in effectiveness of shift worker
interventions. Even the best-designed and structured shift worker training does indeed
need to involve the family. The family is the support network for the shift worker,
which can help managing the work-family conflicts by sharing the same skills and an
understanding of the issues involved.
    The results further indicate that traditional interventions in the form of giving
health focused information on how to maintain alertness during shift work as well as
introducing a healthy diet and exercise, can reduce the level of WFC and FWC
experienced. However, these changes appear to be relatively small and, when
considering only the FWC mean scores, the degree of family work conflict may
increase. It is possible to suggest that this increase in FWC is due to the shift worker’s
learning about different eating and sleeping patterns than those currently present in
the family. If the shift worker suggests that changes to diet and household routines are
implemented, conflict may be heightened by a lack of family awareness of work-related
health requirements. It is also possible that the families feel the changes to be not
feasible or a priority in their lives. Future studies might clarify this point through
interviews and focus group discussions with the effected employees and their families.
As this study is limited to male shift workers, we cannot assess the interaction of
gender roles on work-family. We are also limited by the scope of the study; as this is a
field study, we have no control over other sources of variance at home or in the work
place.
    The reported increase in conflicts regarding disrupted family life in Site B (training
without family involvement) may arise from one of two possible causes. First, it is
ER     conceivable that in the time after the intervention some of the respondents did face
29,2   actual events such as overtime required or scheduling conflicts. These may or may not
       have been out of the ordinary, but after talking about these conflicts in the training
       they might have come more to the attention of the shift workers than before, and thus
       be reported more often. On the other hand, it is possible that the shift workers spoke at
       home with their families about shift work in general, and the training in particular, and
174    thus surfaced the topic, and discovered more family distress than they had previously
       been aware of. These conversations might have brought the issues of limited or
       interrupted social lives to the forefront of the shift workers’ minds and into the
       open-ended question responses. Again, future studies could explore these possibilities
       through in-depth interviews and focus groups with shift workers and their family
       members.
           Overall, the most encouraging finding is that a total reduction in fights about work
       schedules and an increase in family understanding of the shift worker’s support
       requirements is possible if the training focuses on a broad range of behaviours,
       acknowledges family-work issues, and explicitly involves the family in the learning
       process. In combination with the clear results in reduction of work-family conflict of
       this type of intervention, it clearly supports the notion that family, shift worker, and
       workplace form an interdependent unit. If employers wish to increase performance in
       one aspect (i.e. at work), they are well advised to explicitly address the other two as
       well (i.e. work with the employee and the family on managing the complexities
       involved). From the perspective of the employee, merely understanding shift work’s
       negative effects is not enough; effective support involves family awareness and
       engagement.
           The pressures of work and family are accelerating and families, who have
       traditionally borne the brunt of the conflicts experienced between home and work, can
       do little more to sustain balance. Therefore, in addition to acknowledging the necessity
       and sometimes welcoming the new employment patterns of shift work, employees are
       increasingly asking for a more balanced approach to work and social life.
       Consequently, the challenge for society as well as for organisations is to find the
       best possible way to deal with these, sometimes-conflicting demands made on the time
       and energy of shift workers. The main difficulty in this challenge is to find ways to
       enable the employee to cope with the stresses resulting from the increased temporal
       flexibility of social and work organisations (Costa, 2003). While other research has
       suggested that employees are better able to balance shift work and home life demands
       following lifestyle training if it addresses issues of concern to the shift worker and
       includes socialising strategies (Henderson and Burt, 1998; Johnson, 2004), we have
       added to this knowledge base by documenting reduced work-life stress when lifestyle
       training involves family members.
