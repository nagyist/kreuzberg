This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from John Gruber’s markdown test suite.

Headers

Level 2 with an embedded link

Level 3 with emphasis

Level 4

Level 5

Hi.

Level 1

Level 2 with emphasis

Level 3

with no blank line

Level 4

An unnumbered section.

Level 2

with no blank line

Paragraphs

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version 8. This line turns into a list item. Because a hard-wrapped line in the middle of a paragraph looked like a list item.

Here’s one with a bullet. * criminey.

Block Quotes

E-mail style:

  This is a block quote. It is pretty short.

  Code in a block quote:

      sub status {
          print "working";
      }

      sub status {
          print "working with line numbers";
      }

      % ls

  A list:

  1.  item one

  2.  item two

  Nested block quotes:

    nested

    nested

This should not be a block quote: 2 > 1.

And a following paragraph.

Code Blocks

Code:

    ---- (should be four hyphens)

    sub status {
        print "working";
    }

    this code block is indented by one tab

And:

        this code block is indented by two tabs

    These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{

Lists

Unordered

Asterisks loose:

- asterisk 1

- asterisk 2

- asterisk 3

Asterisks tight:

- Plus 2
- Plus 3

2.  Second

3.  Third

and tight:

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

Multiple paragraphs:

1.  Item 1, graf one.

    Item 1. graf two. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog’s back.

2.  Item 2.

3.  Item 3.

Nested

  - Tab

    - Tab

Here’s another:

    - Fie

    - Foe

3.  Third

Same thing but with paragraphs:

1.  First

2.  Second:

    - Fee

    - Fie

    - Foe

3.  Third

Tabs and spaces

- this is a list item indented with tabs

- this is a list item indented with spaces

  - this is an example list item indented with tabs

  - this is an example list item indented with spaces

Fancy list markers

2.  begins with 2

3.  and now 3

    with a continuation

    iv. sublist with roman numerals, starting with 4

    v.  more items

        A.  a subsublist

        B.  a subsublist

Nesting:

A.  Upper Alpha

    I.  Upper Roman.

        6.  Decimal start with 6

            c.  Lower alpha with paren

Autonumbering:

1.  Autonumber.

2.  More.

    1.  Nested.

Should not be a list item:

M.A. 2007

B. Williams

Callout

Simple.

- A __letrec is equivalent to a normal Haskell LET.

- GHC compiled the body of our list comprehension into a loop named go_s1YC.

- If our CASE expression matches the empty list, we return the empty list. This is reassuringly familiar.

Definition Lists

apple

    red fruit

orange

    orange fruit

banana

    yellow fruit

Multiple blocks with italics:

apple

    red fruit

    contains seeds, crisp, pleasant to taste

orange

    orange fruit

        { orange code block }

      orange block quote

Multiple definitions, loose:

apple

    red fruit

    computer

orange

    orange fruit

    bank

Blank line after term, indented marker, alternate markers:

apple

    red fruit

    computer

orange

    orange fruit

    1.  sublist

    2.  sublist

Inline Markup

This is emphasized, and so is this.

This is strong, and so is this.

An emphasized link.

This is strong and em.

So is this word.

This is strong and em.

So is this word.

This is code: >, $, \, \$, <html>.

More code: Class and Type

Referencing a man page: nix.conf(5)

~~This is strikeout.~~

Superscripts: a^(bc)d a^(hello) a^(hello there).

Subscripts: H₂O, H₂₃O, H_(many of them)O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts, because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

“Hello,” said the spider. “‘Shelob’ is my name.”

“A”, “B”, and “C” are letters.

“He said, ‘I want to go.’” Were you alive in the 70’s?

Some dashes: one—two — three—four — five.

Dashes between numbers: 5–7, 255–66, 1987–1999.

Ellipses…and…and….

Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[1] and another.[2] This should not be a footnote reference, because it contains a space.[^my note] Here is an inline note.[3]

  Notes can go in quotes.[4]

1.  And in list items.[5]

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

    1.  Substeps can be nested indefinitely deep.

3.  A Final Step

Index terms

In the simplest case, index terms consists of just a <primary> element, but they can also consist of a <primary> and <secondary> element, and can even include a <tertiary> term.

Index terms can also refer to other index terms: exclusively, using the <see> tag; or as a reference to related terms, using the <seealso> tag.

Nested content in index term elements is flattened.

Abbreviated title

[1] Here is the footnote. It can go anywhere after the footnote reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.

[2] Here’s the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the footnote (as with list items).

      { <code> }

If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be lazy and just indent the first line of each block.

[3] This is easier to type. Inline notes may contain links and ] verbatim characters, as well as [bracketed text].

[4] In quote.

[5] In list.
