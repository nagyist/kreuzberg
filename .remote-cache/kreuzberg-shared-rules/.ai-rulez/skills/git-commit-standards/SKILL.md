# Git & Commit Standards

- Conventional Commits 1.0.0: feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore with scope
- NEVER include AI signatures ("Generated with Claude") in commits
- Pre-commit hooks with prek/lefthook/husky: linting, formatting, tests
- Branch protection: main/development with required status checks
