# Git Commit Conventions

**Human-only authorship · No AI signatures or tool mentions in commits**

- All commits must appear to be authored by humans only
- NEVER include AI signatures like "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" in commit messages
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar AI tool credits
- NEVER mention AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) in commit messages
- Commits must represent genuine human authorship and decision-making
- If AI assistance is used, the human author takes full responsibility and credit
- Enforce: Configure git user.name and user.email to represent human contributors
- Review: All commits during code review must lack AI tool mentions
