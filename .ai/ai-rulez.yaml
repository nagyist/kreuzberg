# AI Rules for Kreuzberg Project
# Guidelines for Claude operations and task delegation

rules:
  # Subagent Usage
  - Use Task tool with specialized subagents for implementation work whenever possible
  - Prefer haiku model for subagents to minimize cost (use model: haiku parameter)
  - Only use sonnet/opus for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning
  - Delegate repetitive tasks (multi-file edits, consistency fixes) to haiku subagents
